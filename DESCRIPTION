Description: R interface to Python modules, classes, and functions. When calling into
  Python R data types are automatically converted to their equivalent Python types. 
  When values are returned from Python to R they are converted back to R types. The
  rpy package is compatible with all versions of Python >= 2.7 and in addition 
  requires NumPy >= 1.11.
