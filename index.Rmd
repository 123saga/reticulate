# R Interface to Python

The **reticulate** package provides a comprensive set of Python interoperability tools for R. 

If you are an R developer that uses Python for some of your work or a member of data science team that uses both languages, reticulate can dramatically streamline your workflow. Reticulte embeds a Python session within your R session, enabling the following types of interoperability:

1) [Python in R Markdown] --- A new Python language engine for R Markdown that supports bi-directional communication between R and Python (R chunks can access Python objects and vice-versa).

2) [Sourcing Python scripts] --- The `source_python()` function enables you to source a Python script the same way you would `source()` an R script (Python functions and objects defined within the script become directly available to the R session).

3) [Importing Python modules] -- The `import()` function enbles you to import any Python module and call it's functions directly from R.

4) [Python REPL] --- The `py_repl()` function creates a Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop") within R. Objects you create within the Python REPL are available to your R session (and vice-versa).

Each of these techniques will be explained in more detail below.

### Getting Started

First, install **reticulate** from GitHub as follows:

``` r
devtools::install_github("rstudio/reticulate")
```

Then, review the examples below and check out the additional articles enumerated in the [Learning More] section.

## Python in R Markdown

The **reticulate** pacakge includes a Python engine for [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) with the following features:

1) Run Python chunks in a single Python session embedded within your R session (shared variables/state between Python chunks)

2) Printing of Python output, including graphical output from [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

3) Access to objects created within Python chunks from R using the `py` object (e.g. `py$x` would access an `x` variable created within Python from R).

4) Access to objects created within R chunks from Python using the `r` object (e.g. `r.x` would access to `x` variable created within R from Python)

Built in conversion for many Python object types is provided, including [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) arrays and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data frames. From example, you can use Pandas to read and manipulate data then easily plot the Pandas data frame using [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) (as illustrated above). 

The reticulate Python engine is enabled by default within R Markdown whenever reticulate is installed. See the `eng_python()` documentation for additional details on the R Markdown Python engine.

## Sourcing Python scripts

You can source any Python script just as you would source an R script using the `source_python()` function. For example, if you had the following Python script *flights.py*:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
import pandas

def read_flights(file):
  flights = pandas.read_csv("flights.csv")
  flights = flights[flights['dest'] == "ORD"]
  flights = flights[['carrier', 'dep_delay', 'arr_delay']]
  flights = flights.dropna()
  return flights
```

Then you can source the script and call the `read_flights()` function as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source_python("flights.py")
flights <- read_flights("flights.csv")

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(flights, aes(carrier, arr_delay)) + geom_point() + geom_jitter()
```

See the `source_python()` documentation for additional details on sourcing Python code.

## Importing Python modules

You can use the `import()` function to import any Python module and call it from R. For example, this code imports the Python `os` module and calls some functions within it:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
os <- import("os")
os$listdir(".")
```
```
 [1] ".git"             ".gitignore"       ".Rbuildignore"    ".RData"          
 [5] ".Rhistory"        ".Rproj.user"      ".travis.yml"      "appveyor.yml"    
 [9] "DESCRIPTION"      "docs"             "external"         "index.html"      
[13] "index.Rmd"        "inst"             "issues"           "LICENSE"         
[17] "man"              "NAMESPACE"        "NEWS.md"          "pkgdown"         
[21] "R"                "README.md"        "reticulate.Rproj" "src"             
[25] "tests"            "vignettes"      
```

Functions and other data within Python modules and classes can be accessed via the `$` operator (analogous to the way you would interact with an R list, environment, or reference class).

## Python REPL

If you want to work with Python interactively you can call the `py_repl()` function, which provides a Python REPL embedded within your R session. Objects created within the Python REPL can be accessed from R using the `py` object exported from reticulate. For example:

![](images/python_repl.png){.screenshot}

Enter `exit` within the Python REPL to return to the R prompt.

Note that Python code can also access objects from within the R session using the `r` object:

![](images/python_r_object.png){.screenshot}

See the `py_repl()` documentation for additional details on using the embedded Python REPL.

## Type conversions

When calling into Python, R data types are automatically converted to their equivalent Python types. When values are returned from Python to R they are converted back to R types. Types are converted as follows:

| R  | Python | Examples |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Single-element vector   | Scalar |  `1`, `1L`, `TRUE`, `"foo"` |
| Multi-element vector | List  |  `c(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)`, `c(1L, 2L, 3L)` |
| List of multiple types  | Tuple  |  `list(1L, TRUE, "foo")`
| Named list | Dict  |  `list(a = 1L, b = 2.0)`, `dict(x = x_data)`
| Matrix/Array | NumPy ndarray  | `matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)`
| Data Frame | Pandas DataFrame | ` data.frame(x = c(1,2,3), y = c("a", "b", "c"))`  |
| Function | Python function | `function(x) x + 1`
| NULL, TRUE, FALSE  | None, True, False  |  `NULL`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`

If a Python object of a custom class is returned then an R reference to that object is returned. You can call methods and access properties of the object just as if it was an instance of an R reference class.

## Why reticulate?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulated_python):

> The reticulated python is a speicies of python found in Southeast Asia. They are the world's longest snakes and longest reptiles...The specific name, reticulatus, is Latin meaning "net-like", or reticulated, and is a reference to the complex colour pattern. 

The reticulate package enables a new flavor of "reticulated" Python code that is weaved closely together with R.
