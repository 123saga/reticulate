# R Interface to Python

The **reticulate** package provides a comprensive set of Python interoperability tools for R. 

If you are an R developer that uses Python for some of your work or a member of data science team that uses both languages, reticulate can dramatically streamline your workflow. Reticulte embeds a Python session within your R session, enabling the following types of interoperability:

1) [Python in R Markdown] --- A new Python language engine for R Markdown that supports bi-directional communication between R and Python (R chunks can access Python objects and vice-versa).

2) [Sourcing Python scripts] --- The `source_python()` function enables you to source a Python script the same way you would `source()` an R script (Python functions and objects defined within the script become directly available to the R session).

3) [Importing Python modules] -- The `import()` function enbles you to import any Python module and call it's functions directly from R.

4) [Python REPL] --- The `py_repl()` function creates a Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop") within R. Objects you create within the Python REPL are available to your R session (and vice-versa).

Each of these techniques will be explained in more detail below.

## Installation

First, install **reticulate** from GitHub as follows:

``` r
devtools::install_github("rstudio/reticulate")
```

Then, review the examples below and check out the additional articles enumerated in the [Learning More] section.

## Python in R Markdown

The reticulate pacakge includes a Python engine for knitr / R Markdown with the following features:

1) Run Python chunks in a single Python session embedded within your R session (shared variables/state between Python chunks)

2) Printing of Python output, including graphical output from [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

3) Access to objects created within Python chunks from R using the `py` object (e.g. `py$x` would access an `x` variable created within Python from R).

4) Access to objects created within R chunks from Python using the `r` object (e.g. `r.x` would access to `x` variable created within R from Python)

Built in conversion for many Python object types is provided, including NumPy arrays and Pandas data frames. From example, you can use Pandas to read and manipulate data then easily plot the Pandas data frame using ggplot2 (as illustrated above). 

The reticulate Python engine is enabled by default within knitr whenever reticulate is installed.

## Sourcing Python scripts

You can source any Python script just as you would source an R script using the `source_python()` function. For example, if you had the following Python script "flights.py":

```{python, eval=FALSE}
import pandas

def read_flights(file):
  flights = pandas.read_csv("flights.csv")
  flights = flights[flights['dest'] == "ORD"]
  flights = flights[['carrier', 'dep_delay', 'arr_delay']]
  flights = flights.dropna()
  return flights
```

Then you can source the script and call the `read_flights()` function as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source_python("flights.py")
flights <- read_flights("flights.csv")

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(flights, aes(carrier, arr_delay)) + geom_point() + geom_jitter()
```

## Importing Python modules

You can use the `import()` function to import any Python module and call it from R. For example, this code imports the Python `os` module and calls some functions within it:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
os <- import("os")
os$chdir("tests")
os$getcwd()
```

Functions and other data within Python modules and classes can be accessed via the `$` operator (analogous to the way you would interact with an R list, environment, or reference class).

## Python REPL

If you want to work with Python interactively you can call the `py_repl()` function, which provides a Python REPL embedded within your R session. Objects created within the Python REPL can be accessed from R using the `py` object exported from reticulate. For example:

![](images/python_repl.png){.screenshot}

Enter `exit` within the Python REPL to return to the R prompt.

Note that Python code can also access objects from within the R session using the `r` object:

![](images/python_r_object.png){.screenshot}



## Type conversions

When calling into Python, R data types are automatically converted to their equivalent Python types. When values are returned from Python to R they are converted back to R types. Types are converted as follows:

| R  | Python | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Single-element vector   | Scalar |  `1`, `1L`, `TRUE`, `"foo"` |
| Multi-element vector | List  |  `c(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)`, `c(1L, 2L, 3L)` |
| List of multiple types  | Tuple  |  `list(1L, TRUE, "foo")`
| Named list | Dict  |  `list(a = 1L, b = 2.0)`, `dict(x = x_data)`
| Matrix/Array | NumPy ndarray  | `matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)`
| Data Frame | Pandas DataFrame | ` data.frame(x = c(1,2,3), y = c("a", "b", "c"))
  x y`  |
| Function | Python function | `function(x) x + 1`
| NULL, TRUE, FALSE  | None, True, False  |  `NULL`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`

## Why reticulate?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulated_python):

> The reticulated python is a speicies of python found in Southeast Asia. They are the world's longest snakes and longest reptiles...The specific name, reticulatus, is Latin meaning "net-like", or reticulated, and is a reference to the complex colour pattern. 

The reticulate package enables a new flavor of "reticulated" Python code that is weaved closely together with R.
