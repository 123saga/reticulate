## Overview

The **reticulate** package includes a Python engine for [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) with the following features:

1) Run Python chunks in a single Python session embedded within your R session (shared variables/state between Python chunks)

2) Printing of Python output, including graphical output from [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

3) Access to objects created within Python chunks from R using the `py` object (e.g. `py$x` would access an `x` variable created within Python from R).

4) Access to objects created within R chunks from Python using the `r` object (e.g. `r.x` would access to `x` variable created within R from Python)

Built in conversion for many Python object types is provided, including [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) arrays and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data frames. From example, you can use Pandas to read and manipulate data then easily plot the Pandas data frame using [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/):

The reticulate Python engine is enabled by default within R Markdown whenever reticulate is installed.
